# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**, a fun and interactive browser-based implementation of the classic two-player game. Developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project emphasizes DOM manipulation, responsive design, and clean game logic. It’s a perfect example of how to build an engaging frontend-only game using core web technologies.

## 🧩 About the Game

Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as "Noughts and Crosses", is a simple strategy game for two players. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of your own marks — either `X` or `O` — on a 3×3 grid.

In this version:

- The game starts when the player clicks the **Start** button.
- Player `O` always goes first.
- Turns alternate between `O` and `X`, indicated visually at the top.
- The game ends when either:
  - A player wins (three in a row)
  - The board is full and no one wins (a draw)
- A **Restart** button allows players to immediately play again without reloading the page.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. **Open `index.html`** in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
2. Click the **Start the Game** button to begin.
3. Player `O` makes the first move by clicking any of the 9 empty boxes.
4. Players take turns until:
   - One player forms a line of 3 (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), or
   - All 9 boxes are filled without a winner — resulting in a draw.
5. Click the **Restart** button to play another round.
